Goal

Modern (latest RFCs) and correct TCP implementation (at least validated)

Tasks

Remove the concept of dup ACKs from TcpConnection
Move dupacks to TcpAlgorithmBase
Rename TcpAlgorithm to ITcpAlgorithm
Take into account the different operation of bbr when designing the architecture
Use isDuplicateAck from Rfc*Recovery classes and remove dupack check condition from TcpConnection
Design TcpCongestionControl C++ interface
Design TcpRecovery C++ interface
Refactor all existing TCP algorithms to the new architecture using separate congestion control and recovery
Validate other TCP algorithms against NS-3
Validate rexmit timer against NS-3
Implement cubic, bbr TCP algorithms based on NS-3
Replace old RFC references with new ones and update the corresponding implementation
Merge the various TcpConnection* files into one
Merge TcpSendQueue and TcpSackRexmitQueue?
Merge TcpNewReno2 into TcpAlgorithmBase?
Implement fast path
Update NED documentation and README files, etc.
Create showcases for TCP validation and TCP algorithm operation
NS-3 vs INET performance comparison, profile and optimize INET
