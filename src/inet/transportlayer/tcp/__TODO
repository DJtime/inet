Goal

 - modernize (latest RFCs) and correct TCP implementation (at least validated to NS-3)

Merge tasks

 - extract ns3 validation example into a real test, commit PCAP files?, commit ns3-patch?
 - replace old RFC references with new ones and update the corresponding implementation
 - design ITcpCongestionControl C++ and ITcpRecovery C++ interface
 - fix broken old congestion control algorithms TcpTahoe, TcpReno, TcpDctcp, etc.
   refactor all existing TCP algorithms to the new architecture using separate congestion control and recovery
 - validate other TCP algorithms against NS-3
 - validate rexmit timer against NS-3
 - update NED documentation and README files, etc.
 - accept new fingerprints by checking statistical test results, i.e. differences should be small enough to be acceptable
 - move GPL TcpCubic to inet-gpl

Future tasks

 - remove the concept of dup ACKs from TcpConnection and move dupacks to TcpAlgorithmBase
 - rename TcpAlgorithm to ITcpAlgorithm and extract non-virtual methods and fields
 - implement bbr TCP algorith and take into account the different operation of bbr when designing the TCP interfaces
 - merge the various TcpConnection* files into one
 - merge TcpSendQueue and TcpSackRexmitQueue?
 - implement fast path
 - NS-3 vs INET performance comparison, profile and optimize INET
 - create showcases for TCP validation and TCP algorithm operation
