%description:

In this test, packets are collected periodically by an active packet sink
(ActivePacketSink). The packets pass through a periodic packet gate if it's
open, otherwise packets are not generated. The packets are provided by a
passive packet source (PassivePacketSource).
Using bitrate in gate.
