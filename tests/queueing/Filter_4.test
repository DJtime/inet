%description:

In this test, packets are produced periodically by an active packet source
(ActivePacketSource). The packets are consumed by a passive packet sink (PassivePacketSink).
Packets are passed through from the source to the sink by a filter (PacketFilter).
The filter pass through the first 5 packets, other packets are dropped.
