%description:

In this test, packets are produced periodically by an active packet source
(ActivePacketSource). The packets are consumed by a passive packet sink (PassivePacketSink).
Packets are passed through from the source to the sink by a duplicator (OrdinalBasedDuplicator).
Every second packet is duplicated based on its ordinal number.
